The gray-eyed king died yesterday. \n \n The autumn evening was sultry and red,\n My husband returned and quietly said:\n\n\"You know, they brought him back from the hunt,\nThey found his corpse by the old oak tree.\n\nI pity the queen. He was so young!..\nIn just one night her hair turned white.\"\n\nHe found his pipe on the mantelpiece\nAnd went out to his nighttime shift.\n\nI'll go and wake my daughter now,\nI'll look into her little gray eyes.\n\n While outside the rustling poplars say:\n\"Your king is no longer upon this earth...\"",

            "text": "The angel was flying through sky in midnight,\n And softly he sang in his flight; \nA nd clouds, and stars, and the moon in a throng\nHearkened to that holy song.\nHe sang of the garden of God's paradise,\nOf innocent ghosts in its shade;\nHe sang of the God, and his vivacious praise\nWas glories and unfeigned.\nThe juvenile soul he carried in arms\nFor worlds of distress and alarms;\nThe tune of his charming and heavenly song \nWas left in the soul for long.\nIt roamed on earth many long nights and days,\nFilled with a wonderful thirst,\nAnd earth's boring songs could not ever replace\nThe sounds of heaven it lost.\n\n"
